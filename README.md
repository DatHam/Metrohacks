# Metrohacks

## Inspiration
I kept on forgetting my friends' birthdays

## What it does
Remembers your friends' birthdays

## How we built it
The chrome extension was built with git and visual studio code, with independent html, json, and js files that work together to make the extension.

## Challenges we ran into
We couldn't figure out how to put inputs into local text files and we ran out of time. Also PHP hurt our brains trying to figure out, and it was hard getting things to work.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We created our own chrome extension with a UI that looks decent (though it doesn't work) using HTML and JavaScript.

## What we learned
We learned basic HTML, Javascript, and how to use git.

## What's next for Birthday Rememberer
Making it actually work. The two main issues are getting input to write to the same file, and using/calling things from the file properly.
